**A client/server application that allows simultaneous editing of text files.***

The project aims to develop a client/server application for simultaneous text file editing.  
          The main purpose is to allow two clients to edit a single file at the same time and manage multiple concurrent editing sessions on different documents.   
          An essential aspect is implementing a communication protocol to ensure the consistency of the edited document in case of simultaneous changes to a common part.
